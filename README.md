# Week2-Homework
I created a personal portfolio page for hw2. I applied flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables in the code and included the following contents in the page: <br />
- My name, photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me. <br />
- When clicking on the link to the section about my work, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section. <br />
- When hovering to one application card in my work section, the corresponding card will become larger in size than other cards. <br />
- When clicking on the images of the applications, you will be taken to that deployed application. <br />
- When resizing the page, a responsive layout will adapt to the viewport.
